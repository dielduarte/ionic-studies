{"league":{"name":"7th-8th Grade HC Invitational 2014-15 League","id":2028,"homeScreen":"Use the nav bar at the top to view the schedule by team and schedule by location (as well as directions).\n\nThe league will play a 10-game regular season with the last game on February 28. The following week there will be a single-elimination playoff to determine the champion.\n\nAll questions should be directed towards your coach.\n\nHave a great season!\n\n**Inclement weather**: Inclement weather procedure depends on your location. Based on your game location, call one of these numbers:\n\n* Meadowbrook, Roger Carter, and North Laurel: 410-313-4452 (option 2)\n* One of the Howard County Schools: 410-313-6827\n\n## Playoff Bracket\n![Playoffs](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20432002/elite-schedule/leagues-2014-15/sat-2015-hc-invitational.png)\n","rulesScreen":"### HS Federation rules will be used except where noted: ###\n\n* The first team listed on the schedule is considered HOME and should wear white (light). Second team listed is away and wears dark jerseys.\n* Home Team Provides game Ball – It should be a NFHS approved 29.5 indoor game ball. If the Home team does not have a NFHS approved ball the Away team can provide a NFHS game ball.\n* **For games not at Meadowbrook, each team must provide a team representative at the scorer’s table for their game. One team covers the book; the other team covers the clock.** Score table persons are provided at Meadowbrook.\n* 20 minute halves. Running Clock except last 1 minute of first half, last 2 minutes of game and all time outs.\n* Two 45 second timeouts per half - Timeouts don’t carry-over from 1st half to 2nd half.\n* **Free Throw Bonus:** We’re trying to minimize wasting playing time shooting fouls shots while the clock runs.   \n**1st half**, NO 1-n-1 bonus at 7 fouls. 2 shot bonus will be shot at 10th foul.  \n**2nd Half**, Same as first half, except when we get to 2 minutes and we are in “stop clock” mode. So, 2 minutes or less in 2nd half, we go to 1-n-1 bonus at 7 fouls.\nSo if there are 3 minutes left in the 2nd half, with 7, 8 or 9 fouls, we are not shooting 1-n-1. If there are 2 minutes or less in the second half with 7, 8 or 9 fouls, we “are” shooting 1-n-1.\n* No pressing or half-court trapping after lead reaches 20 points. Team gets 2 warnings. On third violation, a Team Technical assessed (not counted against individual player) where offense get automatic 2 points and ball at half court.\n* 2 behavior related technical fouls result in removal from current and next game.\n* No technical fouls for book errors. Just correct the mistake and move on.\n* Teams can start game with 4 players. If you have 4 players available at game time, the game must start.\n* **Overtime** - One 2 minute OT. Teams get one additional timeout in OT, two maximum. If still tied after OT, the 10 players on the court immediately go into a “foul shooting shootout.” Players from each team alternate shooting one foul sho,t one player at a time. All ten players shoot. If tied after all 10 players shoot, go back to first players until one team makes it and the other misses. This is similar to a soccer shootout. This is only for regular season. Normal O/Ts in playoffs, not shootout.\n\nThe League Commissioner, will settle all disputes and rule interpretations. If Bill Nap or Steve Michelotti can’t be reached, the lead official will settle dispute or rules."},"teams":[{"divisionName":null,"divisionTeams":[{"id":5947,"name":"Fill-in","coach":"Fill-in"},{"id":5914,"name":"Harundale","coach":"Smith"},{"id":5911,"name":"HC Elite
